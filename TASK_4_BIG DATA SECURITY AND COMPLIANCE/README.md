# ✅ Task 4: Designing a Secure and Compliant Big Data Framework

## 📝 Objective:
To design a framework that ensures secure data handling and compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR and HIPAA within a Big Data system. This task focuses on demonstrating how to handle data responsibly, protect user privacy, and enforce regulatory rules across a data pipeline.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Considered:
- Apache Hadoop / Apache Spark
- Apache Ranger (Access Control)
- Apache Atlas (Data Lineage)
- Encryption (AES, TLS)
- Authentication (Kerberos, IAM)
- Logging (ELK Stack / CloudWatch)
- Compliance Frameworks: GDPR, HIPAA

---

## 🧱 Framework Overview:
The proposed framework consists of the following key layers:
1. **Data Ingestion** – Secure channels (TLS/SSL) with logging.
2. **Data Processing** – Spark jobs with restricted access roles.
3. **Data Storage** – Encryption-at-rest, partitioning, anonymization.
4. **Access Control** – Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using Apache Ranger.
5. **Data Lineage** – Tracked using Apache Atlas.
6. **Monitoring & Auditing** – Continuous logging and alerting on data breaches or policy violations.

---

## 🔐 Security Practices Implemented:
- **Data Encryption:** In-transit and at-rest using TLS and AES.
- **Access Management:** Role-based access using centralized IAM tools.
- **Anonymization & Tokenization:** To protect PII/PHI before processing.
- **Audit Logging:** Capturing all access logs and events for compliance audits.
- **Privacy by Design:** Embedding privacy at every layer of the data lifecycle.

---

## 📜 Compliance Focus:
- **GDPR**: Right to be forgotten, data minimization, consent tracking.
- **HIPAA**: ePHI protection, breach notification, access control policies.

---

## 📄 Deliverables:
- `Secure_BigData_Framework_Report.pdf` – Full report describing the framework.
- `Framework_Architecture_Diagram.png` – (Optional) Visual layout of secure architecture.

---

## ✅ Status:
Task 4 completed. This report can be submitted as the final deliverable to demonstrate secure and compliant data handling in Big Data systems.
